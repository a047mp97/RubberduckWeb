        The Rubberduck Smart Indenter can be previewed @Html.ActionLink("on this very site", "Preview", "Indenter"), this allows you to see <em>just exactly</em> what Rubberduck is capable of.

            The original author and current maintainer of the popular <a href="http://www.oaltd.co.uk/indenter/indentpage.asp" target="_blank">Smart Indenter</a> add-in have graciously offered the latest version of their source code to the Rubberduck project. Thanks to Rob Bovey and Stephen Bullen, Rubberduck 2.0 has the smartest automagic indentation built-in.

        </div>
        <p>
            The <em>Undo Indent</em> feature is not implemented... but it's not needed either, because Rubberduck performs only two operations on code modules when indenting: it first deletes the content, then writes the indented code back in one single operation. The VBE's native <em>undo</em> shortcut (Ctrl+Z) is therefore not overwhelmed, and you can effectively <em>undo indent</em> by simply pressing Ctrl+Z twice.
